## 📋 Step 4: Understanding Custom Instructions Hierarchy

Custom instructions are rules that apply to every Copilot interaction. Which instructions are used depends on the context (personal, repository, or organization level).

### Step 4.1: Instructions Hierarchy

#### Hierarchy Levels:

1. **Personal Instructions** (highest priority)
   - Your individual preferences across all repos
   - Set at: https://github.com/copilot

2. **Repository Instructions** (medium priority)
   - Project-specific requirements
   - File: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

3. **Organization Instructions** (lowest priority)
   - Company-wide standards
   - Set by org admins

#### ⚖️ Balancing Different Instruction Levels

**Personal Instructions**: Your individual preferences across all repositories
- How Copilot talks to you
- Outlining your coding style
- Comment and documentation preferences

**Repository Instructions**: Project-specific requirements (in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- Project architecture patterns
- Specific libraries or frameworks to use
- Team coding standards

**Priority Order:**
1. Personal instructions (highest)
2. Repository instructions
3. Organization instructions (lowest)

When instructions conflict, higher priority ones take precedence.

### Step 4.2: Review Repository Instructions

1. **Open** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in this repository

2. **Notice how it defines:**
   - Project overview and architecture
   - Component patterns
   - Styling conventions
   - Development workflow

3. **Understand how these instructions:**
   - Automatically apply to all Copilot interactions
   - Guide code generation to follow project patterns
   - Maintain consistency across the codebase

#### Example Instructions in This Repo:

The repository instructions file (copilot-instructions.md) includes:
- Project structure overview
- Component usage patterns
- Technology stack information
- Styling conventions
- Best practices for this specific project

These instructions help Copilot generate code that fits seamlessly into the existing codebase.

### Step 4.3: Auto-Generate Repository Instructions

Use the Copilot Chat "Generate Chat Instructions" feature to automatically create (or refine) the repository's `copilot-instructions.md`, then compare and improve it.

1. Open Copilot Chat  
2. Click the gear icon (Configure Chat) → choose **Generate Chat Instructions**
3. Look through the changes that Copilot has suggested making to the instructions file
4. Accept the changes that you think add value to the instructions, and `Undo` the ones that don't

> Tip: You should repeat this process routinely to ensure that the instructions always stay up to date with the codebase. This ensures that Copilot gets the best context possible when working within your code.
