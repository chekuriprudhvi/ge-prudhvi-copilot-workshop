- Use agents in your workflow for autonomous task execution

## 🤖 Step 1: Understanding Custom Agents

### What are Custom Agents?

Custom agents are specialized AI assistants in GitHub Copilot that can be configured with specific expertise, instructions, and behaviors. Unlike the general-purpose Copilot, custom agents are designed for specific tasks, technologies, or workflows.

#### Key Capabilities:

- **Specialized Expertise**: Configure agents with deep knowledge of specific languages, frameworks, or domains
- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents can work independently on tasks, making multiple code changes
- **Tool Access**: Agents can search code, read files, edit code, and more
- **Organization-Wide**: Share agents across your entire organization for consistency
- **Multi-Context**: Use agents in VS Code, CLI, or with Copilot Coding Agent

#### Example Use Cases:

- A **C# Expert** agent that enforces ASP.NET Core best practices and design patterns
- A **Security Reviewer** agent that scans for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes
- A **Testing Specialist** agent that generates comprehensive test suites
- A **Documentation Writer** agent that creates and updates docs based on code changes
- A **Database Expert** agent that helps with query optimization and migrations

### Why Custom Agents?

1. **Consistency**: Ensure all team members follow the same coding standards
2. **Efficiency**: Agents handle routine tasks autonomously
3. **Expertise**: Embed expert knowledge that's always available
4. **Quality**: Built-in best practices reduce code review cycles
5. **Onboarding**: New team members get expert guidance instantly

## 📝 Step 2: Creating a Custom Agent

### Agent Configuration Structure

Custom agents are defined using YAML configuration files with markdown instructions:

```yaml
---
name: Agent Name
description: A brief description of what this agent does
---

Detailed instructions for how the agent should behave.
This is where you define the agent's expertise and approach.
```

### Step 2.1: Create Your First Agent

Let's create a C# expert agent for the BudgetWise project.

#### Instructions:

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code
2. **Click the settings gear icon (⚙️)** at the top of the Copilot Chat panel
3. **Select "Custom Agents"** from the menu
4. **Click "New Custom Agent"**
5. **Choose the location**: Select `.github/agents`
6. **Name the file**: Enter `csharp-expert` (the `.agent.md` extension will be added automatically)
7. **Replace the template content** with the C# expert agent configuration

   You can find the complete configuration in [docs/agents/csharp-expert.md](../docs/agents/csharp-expert.md). Copy the configuration from that file into your new agent file.

### Step 2.2: Test Your Agent

Custom agents are available in VS Code, the Copilot CLI, and with Copilot Coding Agent.

#### Using in VS Code:

1. **Open Copilot Chat** in VS Code
2. **Select your custom agent** from the mode dropdown
3. **Test with a prompt**:

   ```
   Review the BudgetWise Controllers and suggest improvements for C# best practices
   ```

#### Using with Copilot CLI:

If you have the Copilot CLI installed:

1. Run `copilot` to start an interactive session
    - If necessary go through the first start requirements (i.e., authenticating, configuring terminal, etc.)
2. Run 
```bash
agent csharp-expert "Review the BudgetWise Controllers and suggest improvements for C# best practices"
```

#### Using with Copilot Coding Agent:

In Lab 9, you'll learn how to delegate tasks to Copilot Coding Agent and can select this custom agent as part of that workflow.
