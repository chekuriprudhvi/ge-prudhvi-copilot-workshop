## 💰 Scenario: Scaling Development at BudgetWise

BudgetWise is growing rapidly, and your development backlog is overflowing with enhancement requests:
- Users want new profile or detail pages
- Users want sharing or export functionality
- The application needs better filtering capabilities
- Documentation needs updates

Your manager has heard about GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent, an autonomous AI developer that can work independently on GitHub issues, just like a human team member. Today, you'll explore this revolutionary feature by:
1. **Delegating your first task** to Coding Agent
2. **Working on something else** in your IDE while CCA runs autonomously
3. **Experiencing parallel development** by managing multiple tasks simultaneously

> **🚀 Key Lab Focus: Asynchronous & Parallel Development**
> 
> This lab demonstrates CCA's two fundamental benefits:
> 1. **Asynchronous work**: Delegate a large task to CCA and immediately shift your focus to other work in your IDE with no waiting and no idle time
> 2. **Parallel development**: Run multiple CCA tasks simultaneously while you work on additional features
> 
> You'll experience this by assigning a feature to CCA, then building another feature in your IDE while CCA works autonomously. This demonstrates how CCA multiplies your productivity. You code one thing while CCA handles another, all happening at the same time!
>
> This lab gives you the ability to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. However, that doesn't mean that you _have_ to juggle all of the different tasks at the same time. As this is for learning purposes work at the speed you feel most comfortable with until you are accustomed to Copilot Coding Agent!

## 🤖 Introduction to Coding Agent

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lab includes simulated data on traditional development timelines and how CCA can accelerate them. Actual results may vary based on task complexity, repository size, and GitHub services load. None of the data is meant to set specific expectations but rather to illustrate the potential of autonomous development.

**GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** is an autonomous AI developer that works directly on GitHub issues. Unlike the interactive IDE modes (Ask, Plan, Agent), Coding Agent works independently after being assigned an issue.

### What Coding Agent Can Do:

- ✅ Fix bugs and address issues
- ✅ Implement incremental new features
- ✅ Improve test coverage
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Address technical debt
- ✅ Refactor code for better maintainability
- ✅ Implement accessibility improvements
- ✅ Optimize performance
- ✅ Update dependencies
- ✅ Migrate deprecated APIs

### 🎯 The Power of Autonomous Development

Coding Agent represents a fundamental shift in software development:

**Traditional Sequential Workflow:**
```
Task 1: New Feature Page
1. Read requirements
2. Write code (30-45 min)
3. Test
4. Create PR

Then start Task 2: Another Feature
1. Read requirements  
2. Write code (30-45 min)
3. Test
4. Create PR

Total: 60-90 minutes of back-to-back coding
```

**With Coding Agent (Parallel Workflow):**
```
9:00 AM  - Assign Task 1 to @copilot
9:02 AM  - Start working on Task 2 yourself in IDE
9:30 AM  - Finish Task 2, check on CCA
9:35 AM  - Review CCA's completed Task 1 PR

Total: 30-35 minutes, TWO features complete!
```

**The Key Insight**: While Coding Agent works autonomously on one task, you remain productive on another. No waiting, no idle time; just continuous forward progress.

### 💡 When to Use Coding Agent

**Perfect For:**
```markdown
✅ Well-defined feature additions
   "Add search filter to the main list page"
   
✅ Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
   "Fix sorting issue in the data grid"
   
✅ Test coverage improvements
   "Add tests for the main component"
   
✅ Documentation updates
   "Document the API endpoints"
   
✅ Code quality improvements
   "Refactor the data handler for better performance"
   
✅ Accessibility enhancements
   "Add ARIA labels to navigation"
   
✅ Routine refactoring
   "Extract reusable utility functions"
```

**Not Ideal For:**
```markdown
❌ Architectural decisions
   Too complex, requires human judgment
   
❌ Ambiguous requirements
   "Make the app better" - too vague
   
❌ Multiple unrelated changes
   Breaks single responsibility principle
   
❌ Business logic decisions
   Needs product/stakeholder input
   
❌ Cross-team coordination
   Requires human communication
```

### 🔬 Understanding Coding Agent's Capabilities

#### **Advanced Code Understanding**
Coding Agent uses sophisticated analysis:

**1. Repository-Wide Context**
- Analyzes entire codebase structure
- Understands existing patterns
- Identifies related files automatically
- Recognizes architectural decisions

**2. Intelligent Planning**
- Breaks down complex tasks into steps
- Identifies dependencies
- Plans optimal file change sequence
- Anticipates edge cases

**3. Quality Assurance**
- Runs existing test suites
- Creates new tests when appropriate
- Validates against linters
- Ensures code style consistency

**4. Self-Documentation**
- Explains decisions in commit messages
- Documents reasoning in PR description
- Highlights important changes
- Notes any limitations

#### **The RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Advantage**

Coding Agent doesn't just generate code blindly:

```markdown
Traditional AI:
"Generate a component/service"
→ Creates generic code

Coding Agent with RAG:
"Generate a component/service"
→ Searches codebase for existing patterns
→ Finds similar existing components
→ Reviews type definitions/interfaces
→ Checks styling/convention patterns
→ Examines test approaches
→ Creates code matching project style
```

**Result**: Code that feels like it was written by your team

### How Coding Agent Works:

**1. Assignment & Activation:**
- Assign a GitHub issue to `@copilot` like any team member
- Copilot adds a 👀 emoji reaction to show it's working
- Spins up a secure GitHub Actions environment

**2. Autonomous Development:**
- Analyzes the codebase using advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Plans implementation approach
- Creates a new branch (always prefixed with `copilot/`)
- Writes and commits code incrementally

**3. Quality Assurance:**
- Runs existing tests and linters
- Creates new tests when appropriate
- Validates changes against repository standards
- Documents reasoning in commit messages

**4. Pull Request & Review:**
- Opens a draft pull request with detailed description
- Provides session logs showing decision-making process
- Requests review from the original issue assignor
- Responds to feedback and iterates based on comments

### 🎨 Coding Agent Architecture Patterns

#### **Pattern 1: The Incremental Build**

For larger features, break into smaller issues:

```markdown
Issue #1: Basic structure
└─ Copilot creates foundation
   └─ Review & merge

Issue #2: Core functionality
└─ Copilot builds on #1
   └─ Review & merge

Issue #3: Polish & optimize
└─ Copilot refines everything
   └─ Review & merge

Benefits: Manageable chunks, continuous progress, easier review
```

#### **Pattern 2: The Test-Driven Approach**

```markdown
Issue: "Add filtering to the main list"

Copilot's Process:
1. First, write failing tests for filter functionality
2. Commit tests
3. Then, implement filter to make tests pass
4. Commit implementation

Result: Well-tested, reliable code
```

### 🎯 Maximizing Coding Agent Effectiveness

#### **Write Better Issues**

**Transform Vague to Specific:**

❌ Vague:
```markdown
Title: Improve the app
Body: Make it better
```

```

### Coding Agent vs. IDE Agent Mode:

| Feature | IDE Agent Mode | Coding Agent |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Location | VS Code | GitHub.com |
| Interaction | Interactive, conversational | Autonomous, delegated |
| Scope | Current files/workspace | Entire repository |
| Workflow | Real-time collaboration | Asynchronous task completion |
| Output | Direct code changes | Pull request with review |
| Best For | Exploratory development | Well-defined tasks |

## 📝 Step 1: Assign Your First Task to Coding Agent

Let's start by delegating a single well-defined task to Coding Agent. You'll create an issue, assign it to @copilot, and briefly observe how it starts working.

### Instructions:

1. **Ensure GitHub Issues are enabled** for your repository. If you don't see an Issues tab or if accessing issues gives you an error:
   - Go to `Settings` > `General`
   - Scroll to the `Features` section
   - Check the `Issues` box (enable it)
   - Return to the repository (refresh if needed) before proceeding

2. **Navigate to Issues:**
   - Go to the **Issues** tab in your GitHub repository
   - Click **"New Issue"** button

3. **Create a well-defined issue:**

   **Title**: `Add profile page`

   **Description**:
   ```markdown
   ## User Story
   As a user of BudgetWise, I want a profile page where I can view my information and activity.

   ## Requirements
   - Create a new route/endpoint at `/profile`
   - Design a profile page with:
     - Profile header section (name, avatar placeholder, bio)
     - Activity or featured content section
     - Use existing components where possible
     - Use mock data for profile information
   - Use C# with proper type definitions
   - Style consistent with the existing design system
   - Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
   - Include dark mode support if applicable

   ## Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] Profile page is accessible at `/profile`
   - [ ] Page displays profile header and bio section
   - [ ] Featured content shown using existing components
   - [ ] Mock data shows realistic profile information
   - [ ] Responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - [ ] Follows existing component patterns
   - [ ] No C# errors
   - [ ] Consistent with existing design system

   ## Technical Notes
   - Reference existing components at `budgetwise-app/src/components/`
   - Create mock profile data in `budgetwise-app/src/services/`
   - Follow page layout patterns from existing pages
   ```

4. **Create the issue** by clicking "Submit new issue"

5. **Assign to Copilot:**
   - In the issue sidebar, under **"Assignees"**, click the dropdown and select **"Copilot"**
   - In the popup:
     - Verify the target repository is correct
     - Ensure the base branch is `main` (or your default branch)
     - Click **"Assign"**

6. **Observe Copilot Starting to Work:**
   - Copilot will add a 👀 emoji to indicate it's started working
   - A comment will appear showing Copilot is planning its approach
   - **Take a minute or two to read through the plan** - notice how Copilot analyzes the codebase and identifies relevant files

7. **Watch the Session Begin:**
   - Click on the issue number to view the timeline
   - Wait about 1-2 minutes, then refresh the page
   - You should see a link to **"View Session"** - click it to see Copilot's work in real-time
   - Observe the first few steps: context gathering, file analysis, initial code generation

### 💡 What's Happening Behind the Scenes?

While you're watching, Copilot is:
- 🔍 Analyzing your repository structure and existing patterns
- 📋 Creating a detailed implementation plan
- 🔧 Identifying which components to reuse
- ✍️ Starting to write code that matches your project style
- 🧪 Planning what tests to create

**Key Insight**: This work is happening **autonomously**. Copilot doesn't need you to guide it through each step because it's working like an independent team member!

### 💡 Tips for Writing Good Issues for Coding Agent

**Use the Checklist Method** to break down complexity:

```markdown
Title: Implement feature with validation

Body:
## Feature Checklist
- [ ] Core functionality implementation
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Success feedback to user
- [ ] Loading/progress states

## Technical Checklist
- [ ] Follow existing component/service patterns
- [ ] Add validation utilities
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Update documentation
```

**Be Specific with Context**:
- Reference existing components/classes with @-mentions or file paths
- Specify file locations
- Link to similar features
- Include technical constraints

## 💻 Step 2: Work on a Different Task in Your IDE (Parallel Development!)

Now comes the **key insight** about Coding Agent: you don't sit and wait! While CCA works autonomously on the profile page, you'll be productive on a completely different task.

Let's build another feature using **Copilot Agent mode in VS Code** while Coding Agent works in parallel on GitHub.

### Why This Matters

**Traditional approach**: Wait 10-15 minutes for one task to complete before starting the next.

**With CCA**: Start a task, let it run autonomously, and immediately begin working on something else. Two features progress in parallel!

### Instructions:

1. **Open VS Code** (or your GitHub Codespace if you're using one)

2. **Open Copilot Chat Panel**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Alt+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+I` (Mac)
   - Or click the chat icon in the sidebar

3. **Switch to Agent Mode**

4. **Create Another Feature**:

   Create a prompt in the chat panel that requests a new component for your application. Your prompt should specify:
   - The functionality you want to add
   - File location and patterns to follow
   - Styling requirements
   - Integration with existing components
   
   <details>
   <summary>💡 Example Prompt</summary>

   ```
   I need to add a sharing feature to the BudgetWise. 
   
   Create a ShareButton component that allows users to share content:
   - Twitter/X
   - Facebook  
   - Copy link to clipboard
   
   Requirements:
   - Place in budgetwise-app/src/components/
   - Follow existing component patterns
   - Style appropriately for the design system
   - Include proper C# types
   - Make it mobile-responsive
   - Support dark mode if applicable
   
   Then integrate it into an existing component so content can be shared.
   ```
   </details>

5. **Let Agent Mode Work**:
   - Copilot will propose changes to index.html and possibly create new JavaScript
   - Review the proposed changes in the chat panel
   - Click **"Keep"** to accept the changes

6. **Debug and Refine** (Important Learning!):
   - Try to run the app with your development command
   - If there are any errors or issues, **use Copilot to help debug**:
     ```
     I'm getting an error: [paste error here]
     Please help me fix it.
     ```
   - Work through any issues with Copilot's help. **As this is just a training workshop, it's totally fine if you aren't able to get things fully implemented. The goal is to learn with Agent mode and have Copilot help resolve issues that come up.**

7. **Test Your Changes**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate page
   - Verify the new functionality appears
   - Test the different options

### ⏱️ Time Check: How Long Has It Been?

Look at the clock - you've probably spent **10-15 minutes** building the feature. 

**Now for the magic**: While you were working on this feature in your IDE, Coding Agent has been autonomously building the profile page on GitHub! Let's check on its progress.

### 💡 What Just Happened?

You experienced **true parallel development**:
- ✅ Coding Agent worked on the profile page (GitHub)
- ✅ You worked on the sharing feature (IDE)
- ✅ Two features progressed simultaneously
- ✅ Zero idle waiting time
- ✅ Double the productivity!

## 🔍 Step 3: Check on Coding Agent and Review the PR

Now let's see what Coding Agent has accomplished while you were working on the other feature!

### Instructions:

1. **Navigate back to GitHub**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.com
   - Click the **Issues** tab
   - Find the profile page issue you created

2. **Check the Progress**:
   - Look for a link to the PR in the issue timeline (Development section)
   - Click to open the Pull Request
   - Notice it should be marked **"Ready for review"** (or close to it)

3. **Review the PR Description**:
   - Read Copilot's summary of what was implemented
   - Check that the acceptance criteria are addressed
   - Review the implementation approach Copilot chose

4. **Examine the Code Changes**:
   - Click the **"Files changed"** tab
   - Review the files Copilot modified. You could see changes to:
     - New profile page route
     - Mock profile data
     - Integration with existing components
     - Type definitions
     - Styling consistency

5. **Check the Session Logs**:
   - In the PR timeline, find and click **"View Session"**
   - Explore Copilot's decision-making:
     - What files it analyzed
     - How it chose to structure the code
     - What patterns it followed
     - Tests it created (if any)

### 💡 Reflection: What Just Happened?

**Timeline Recap (example):**
```
9:00 AM  - You assigned profile page to Coding Agent
9:02 AM  - You started building sharing feature in IDE
9:30 AM  - You finished sharing feature (with Copilot's help debugging)
9:35 AM  - You reviewed Coding Agent's completed profile page PR

Results:
✅ Profile page: COMPLETE (built by Coding Agent)
✅ Sharing feature: COMPLETE (built by you with IDE Agent)
✅ Time: ~35 minutes for TWO features
✅ Your idle time: ZERO
```

**The CCA Advantage**: Not only did you save time, but you could have been doing **anything else** while CCA worked, including meetings, planning, reviews, or even taking a break. The key is that development continues autonomously.

### 🔍 Understanding Session Logs

Session logs provide deep insight into Copilot's decision-making:

- **Context Gathering**: What files and patterns Copilot analyzed
- **Planning**: The implementation approach it chose and why
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step code changes with reasoning
- **Testing**: Tests run and validation performed
- **Problem-Solving**: How it handled challenges
- **Agent Selection**: If custom agents were used

Use session logs to:
- Understand why Copilot made specific choices
- Learn about code patterns in your repository
- Identify when to provide guidance
- Debug issues if something doesn't work as expected

## 🔄 Step 4: Request Changes and Iterate

Let's practice the review and iteration workflow. Even if the PR looks good, request a small enhancement to see how Copilot responds to feedback.

### How to Request Changes

If you spot issues or want improvements:

1. **Navigate to the PR's "Files changed" tab**

2. **Add inline comments** on specific lines:
   - Click the `+` icon next to any line of code
   - Write specific feedback
   - Click "Start a review"

3. **Or add general feedback** in the main PR conversation:
   ```markdown
   @copilot This looks great! Can you make the following improvements:
   
   1. Add a "Contact" or action button in the header section
   2. Add a loading skeleton state while data is loading
   3. Add a count display (e.g., "24 items" above the grid)
   
   Please follow the existing UI patterns for these additions.
   ```

4. **Submit your review**:
   - Click "Review changes" button
   - Select "Request changes"
   - Add summary comment. **IMPORTANT**: You must explicitly tag `@copilot` in your comment for it to see the feedback!
   - Submit

5. **Wait for Coding Agent to respond**:
   - Look for the 👀 to know Copilot sees your comments
   - Copilot will read your feedback
   - Make the requested changes
   - Push new commits
   - Comment when ready for re-review

### ⏱️ While Copilot Iterates: Learn About Scaling to Multiple Tasks

**Important**: Copilot is now working on your requested changes. This will take approximately **5-10 minutes**. 

Instead of waiting, let's talk about how to scale this workflow even further by delegating **multiple tasks simultaneously** to Coding Agent...

## 🚀 Step 5: Scale to Multiple Parallel Tasks

Now that you understand how CCA works with a single task, let's explore its true power: **delegating multiple tasks simultaneously**.

### 🎯 The Multi-Track Development Pattern

You've seen how CCA handles one task while you work on another. Now imagine:

```
Your Morning (9:00 AM):
1. Assign Task A to @copilot - "Add login page"
2. Assign Task B to @copilot - "Add search filtering"  
3. Work on Task C yourself - "Implement complex feature" (needs your expertise)

10:30 AM:
- Task A: PR ready for review ✓
- Task B: PR ready for review ✓
- Task C: You're making good progress

11:00 AM:
- Review and merge Tasks A & B
- Assign Task D to @copilot - "Update documentation"
- Continue on Task C

Result: 3-4 features progressing with same effort as 1!
```

### 💪 When to Use Multiple Parallel Tasks

**Perfect Scenarios:**
- ✅ You have 3-5 well-defined, independent tasks
- ✅ Tasks touch different parts of the codebase
- ✅ You can review multiple PRs in your available time
- ✅ No dependencies between the tasks

**Avoid When:**
- ❌ Tasks modify the same files (merge conflicts!)
- ❌ Tasks depend on each other (Task B needs Task A done first)
- ❌ You don't have bandwidth to review multiple PRs
- ❌ Requirements aren't clear enough

### 📋 Let's Try It: Create More Issues

While Copilot is still working on your profile page changes, let's assign it additional independent tasks.

Create and assign these additional issues to Copilot:

**Issue 1: Search Functionality**
```markdown
Title: Add search bar to main list

## User Story
As a user, I want to search items by title or keywords.

## Requirements
- Add search input above the main list/grid
- Filter items in real-time as user types
- Show "No results" message when appropriate
- Clear search button

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search bar above main content
- [ ] Real-time filtering as user types
- [ ] "No results" state displays correctly
- [ ] Clear button works
- [ ] Mobile responsive
```

**Issue 2: Documentation**
```markdown
Title: Create README for new features

## Requirements
- Document the new profile page functionality
- Explain any new components
- Add troubleshooting section
- List any known limitations
```

### 🎯 What You Now Have Running

Let's count your parallel tracks:

1. **Profile page** - Copilot is making your requested changes
2. **Search feature** - Copilot just started working
3. **Sharing feature** - YOU built this earlier (done!)

**Multiple features in various stages of completion!** This is the multi-track development pattern in action.

### ⏱️ Time Management

Over the next **15-20 minutes**:
- All CCA tasks will complete (_subject to complexity and GitHub services load_)
- You can review them as they finish (don't wait for all!)
- Review and merge independently
- Maybe grab coffee while they work! ☕

### 💡 Best Practices for Multi-Task Management

**DO:**
- ✅ Start with 2-3 parallel tasks as you learn
- ✅ Assign tasks to different codebase areas
- ✅ Review and merge PRs as they complete (don't batch them)
- ✅ Keep a task board/list of what CCA is working on
- ✅ Check in every 15-20 minutes

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Assign 10 tasks at once (you'll drown in reviews!)
- ❌ Assign dependent tasks simultaneously
- ❌ Forget about tasks you assigned (set reminders!)
- ❌ Assign tasks that modify the same files

### 📊 Tracking Your Parallel Work

GitHub provides tools to track CCA sessions:

1. **Visit**: [github.com/copilot/agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents)
2. **See**: All your active and completed CCA sessions
3. **Monitor**: Progress on each task
4. **Access**: Session logs for any task

**Pro Tip**: Bookmark this page and check it periodically when you have multiple tasks assigned!

## 🔍 Step 6: Review All Completed PRs

By now, your parallel tasks should be completing. Let's review them efficiently!

### Review Workflow for Multiple PRs

For **each PR**:

1. **Check PR Status**:
   - Navigate to Pull Requests tab
   - Look for "Ready for review" status
   - Open each PR in a separate browser tab

2. **Quick Review Process**:
   - **Read the description**: What did Copilot implement?
   - **Check acceptance criteria**: All items addressed?
   - **Review "Files changed"**: Scan the code changes
   - **Check session logs**: Understand decisions made

3. **Approve or Request Changes**:
   - If satisfied: Approve and merge
   - If issues found: Leave specific feedback (Copilot will auto-respond)
   - Don't wait to review all PRs together; review and merge as each one is ready!

- Add UI for data input
```

**4. Documentation:**
```markdown
Title: Create API documentation for new features
- Document all new endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- List all parameters
- Create README section for API usage
```

### 🎯 Challenge: Assign All Tasks Simultaneously!

**Instructions:**
1. Create all issues (don't wait between them)
2. Assign all to @copilot back-to-back
3. Watch as all tasks progress in parallel
4. Track progress on all PRs
5. Review and merge as they complete

**Expected Outcome:**
- All tasks complete in ~15-20 minutes total
- Sequential development would take 60-80 minutes
- You've just experienced a significant productivity multiplier!

### Pro Tips for Scaling Parallel Development:

- **Start with 2-3 tasks** until you're comfortable with the workflow
- **Scale up gradually** to 4-6 parallel tasks as you build confidence
- **Track your review capacity**: Don't create more PRs than you can review
- **Use labels and projects**: Organize issues by priority and category
- **Monitor progress periodically**: Check session logs every 10-15 minutes
- **Iterate on feedback**: Don't wait for all PRs to complete before reviewing
- **Merge incrementally**: Approve and merge PRs as they're ready, don't wait for all to complete

### 📊 Measuring Your Productivity Gain

**Traditional Sequential Development:**
- Task 1: 15 minutes
- Task 2: 15 minutes  
- Task 3: 15 minutes
- Task 4: 15 minutes
- **Total: 60 minutes of heads-down coding**

**Parallel Development with CCA:**
- All 4 tasks: ~20 minutes (running simultaneously)
- Your time: Review and guidance only
- **Total: 20 minutes + you can work on other things**
- **Productivity multiplier: 3x-4x**

This is the transformational benefit of Coding Agent - your capacity is no longer limited by your personal coding time!

### What Coding Agent Does Well:

- ✅ Incremental feature additions to existing patterns
- ✅ Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- ✅ Test coverage improvements
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Refactoring following established patterns
- ✅ Accessibility improvements
- ✅ Performance optimizations with specific goals

### What to Avoid:

- ❌ Major architectural changes
- ❌ Security-critical implementations without review
- ❌ Complex multi-system integrations
- ❌ Tasks requiring external system access
- ❌ Ambiguous or poorly-defined requirements
- ❌ Tasks that need human judgment or business decisions

### Security Considerations:

- **Always review** Copilot's code before merging
- **Don't blindly trust** security-related changes
- **Verify** any external dependencies added
- **Test thoroughly** before deploying to production
- **Use branch protection** rules to require human review

## 🌐 Step 7: Alternative Ways to Work with Coding Agent

There are multiple ways to interact with Coding Agent beyond the GitHub Issues UI.

### Method 1: Agent Panel

The Agent Panel provides a dedicated interface for managing Copilot tasks:

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/copilot/agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents)
2. Select your repository from the dropdown
3. Describe a task in the text box
4. Click **"Start Task"** to create a PR without a formal issue

**Documentation**: [Agent Panel Guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-the-agents-panel-or-page)

### Method 2: Visual Studio Code

Delegate tasks directly from your IDE while coding:

1. Start your prompt with `@cloud`, you'll notice after adding `@cloud` a ghost description appears describing what this chat-participant does
2. Describe the task you want to delegate to CCA
3. Submit your prompt
4. Click `Delegate` to start the process

**Documentation**: [VS Code Integration](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-copilot-chat-in-visual-studio-code)

### Method 3: GitHub CLI

Assign tasks from the command line:

```bash
gh agent-task create --title "Your task title" --body "Task description"
```

**Documentation**: [GitHub CLI Guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-the-github-cli)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Just because you can delegate several tasks to Copilot Coding Agent at the same time does not mean you always should or need to. 
>
> Like with all things moderation is key. Strive to ensure that the tasks you give to CCA are the best fit for it and aren't more than you can handle. 
>
> While the following are a good baseline on how to decide what tasks are best for Copilot Coding Agent you will need to use your judgement on a case by case basis so you can get the maximum benefit of these tools!
